        A picture or video is worth a thousand words.

        If applicable, drag and drop screenshots or a screen recording to help explain your problem. If your file is too big for Github to accept, try to compress it (ZIP file), or feel free to paste a link to an image/video hoster here instead. Please do not use links from youtube.com. If you need to use a youtube video, please use a link from a privacy-friendly client.
